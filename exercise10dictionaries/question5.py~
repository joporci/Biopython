#(15%) Modify the previous code in such a way that the user can input as many sequences as he desires, and the tuples now have a 5th position that counts any other character different to a valid nucleotide. For example, if the user inputs 2 sequences: 
nucleotides= raw_input("Enter sequences: ").lower()
list1=[]
while nucleotides != '':
	list1=list1 + [nucleotides]
	nucleotides= raw_input("Enter sequences: ").lower()
def count_nucleotides():
	lista = []
	for sequence in list1:
		counterA=0
		counterT=0
		counterG=0
		counterC=0
		counterX=0
		string='bdefhijklmnopqrsuvwxyz'
		for char in sequence:
			if char == 'a':
				counterA=counterA + 1
			if char == 't':
				counterT=counterT + 1
			if char == 'g':
				counterG=counterG + 1
			if char == 'c':
				counterC=counterC + 1 
			lista=lista + [(counterA,counterT,counterG,counterC,counterX=(len(sequence)-(int(counterA)) +int(counterT) +int(counterG) + int(counterC))]
			return lista
print count_nucleotides()
